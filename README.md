## :bulb: Motivation for building Movie Notes
As a movie enthusiast, I often struggled to keep track of all the movies I had watched, my favorites, and those I planned to see in the future. I wanted a single place where I could organize my movie experiencesâ€”what I've watched, what I love, what I'm currently watching, and what I plan to watch next. Additionally, I wanted a way to easily store and access recommendations from friends and family so that I wouldn't forget them. Most importantly, I hoped to connect with fellow movie lovers and share our experiences. Movie Notes was built to bring all these elements together into one platform, making it easier to explore, organize, and enjoy movies while fostering a sense of community among movie enthusiasts.

The app also includes social features that allow users to connect with one another, chat, and share movie recommendations and experiences. This fosters a sense of community and helps users discover new movies through personalized recommendations.

Whether you are a casual viewer or a dedicated movie enthusiast, Movie Notes is a must-try!

## :bulb: Motivation for building Movie Notes
As a movie enthusiast, I often struggled to keep track of all the movies I had watched, my favourites, and those I planned to see in the future. I wanted a single place where I could organize my movie experiencesâ€”what I've watched, what I love, what I'm currently watching, and what I plan to watch next. Additionally, I wanted a way to easily store and access recommendations from friends and family so that I wouldn't forget them. Most importantly, I hoped to connect with fellow movie lovers and share our experiences. Movie Notes was built to bring all these elements together into one platform, making it easier to explore, organize, and enjoy movies while fostering a sense of community among movie enthusiasts.

## :open_book: Features of the application
**1. User Account Management:**
Movie Notes offers secure user authentication using `Flask-WTForms`. Users can create password-protected accounts with validation checks for secure login and logout, ensuring secure access to their personal data and movie experiences.

**2. Effortless and seamless Movie Discovery:**
Movie Notes streamlines movie discovery and tracking by allowing users to enter a movie title into a search bar, which triggers an HTTP request to IMDb.com using the `requests` library. The response is then processed with **Beautiful Soup** to extract key details like the title, release date, poster, and cast. This information is immediately displayed, enabling users to effortlessly add movies to their personalized sections: Watched, Currently Watching, Favourites, or Watchlist.

By utilizing HTTP requests and web scraping, Movie Notes ensures a smooth and intuitive movie-tracking experience for users.

**3. Dynamic Movie Categorization:**
Movie Notes lets you easily organize your movie experiences into Watched, Favourites, Watchlist, Currently Watching, and Recommendations sections. To add a movie to any of the sections, a user selects the section from a pop-up menu. The selected option triggers a `fetch` request, sending the movie data and chosen section to the server, where `Flask` processes the request and stores the information in a `SQLite` database, ensuring all sections are updated in real time.

**4. Organized Watched History**
Movie Notes allows users to organize movies in the Watched section by the date they were viewed. When selecting a movie to add, a date input menu appears, enabling users to specify when they watched it. This information is stored alongside the movie details in the `SQLite` database. Later, users can easily view their watched movies categorized by year and month, providing insights into their viewing history. 

**Note:** This feature is available only for movies that have a watched date recorded.

**5. Social Connectivity:**
Movie Notes also has social features that foster interaction among users and community. These social features include:
- **Friending Feature**  
  Users can connect with fellow movie enthusiasts by sending friend requests, once accepted, they become "Movie Buddies" and can view each other's movie notes. The status of these friendships is stored in the `SQLite` database.

- **In-App Chat**  
  The app features a chat feature that allows users can chat with their "Movie Buddies" directly within the app, fostering social interaction around shared movie experiences. 

- **Viewing Friends' Movie Notes**  
  Users can explore the movie notes of their "Movie Buddies", gaining insights into their preferences and recommendations. The app retrieves relevant data based on the user's friend sections stored in the database.

- **Making and Receiving Recommendations**  
  Users can recommend movies to Movie Buddies and view suggestions made to them, encouraging the sharing and the discovery of new movies. This feature tracks recommendations in the database, allowing users to access suggestions based on their connections.
